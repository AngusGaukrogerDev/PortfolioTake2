                        My time working at Loop Technology has exposed me to many types of projects and technologies.

                        <i class="bi bi-check"></i>In my free time outside of work, I have been learning .NET based web technologies. Hence the desire to build this Portfolio website using ASP.NET CORE MVC.
                        I very much enjoy the challenge of web development, as it is a very different challenge to what  have previously encountered in my work. I have an interest in all parts of the stack, although I find that CSS can be rather frustrating at times!
                    </li>
                    <li><i class="bi bi-check"></i> In .NET I have experience designing WPF applications (MVVM), ASP.NET CORE (MVC, Razor Pages), ASP.NET Web Forms, Windows Forms and Windows Console Applications. As well as this, I have written code for various embedded projects, using languages such as C, C++, Python as well as the Kuka Robot Language.</li>
